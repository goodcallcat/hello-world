# hello-world
this is for learning
Ultimate goals consist of making an iPhone app tentatively called "Snake Game: The Pythoning", using a probability engine to determine the results of ball python breeding combinations. I want to start simple and make updates with higher complexity as I learn.
I will need to make a cursory list of common Ball Python genes and assign their probability. This information is easy to find on the internet.
